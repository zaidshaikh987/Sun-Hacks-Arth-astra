# ArthAstra Finance 🚀  
*The Intelligent, Voice‑First Financial Companion*

ArthAstra is a voice‑first, agentic‑AI powered financial companion for Indian borrowers.  
It uses Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini 2.5 Flash, forensic document vision and deterministic financial tools to turn confusing loan journeys (and rejections) into clear, actionable roadmaps.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- **Audience:** Indian borrowers who want to understand eligibility, compare offers, and recover from rejections.  
- **Core idea:** Combine **structured calculators** (DTI, EMI, eligibility) with **multi‑agent AI** and **bilingual voice** so users get both hard numbers and human‑like guidance.  
- **Form factor:** Responsive **Next.js 16** app with a deep **dashboard + sidebar** UX and always‑available AI assistant.

|  | Recovery Agent | `/dashboard/rejection-recovery` | ADK pipeline that diagnoses rejection, designs strategy and roadmap. |
| **ACCOUNT** | Settings | `/dashboard/settings` | Update profile, preferences and language. |
|  | Logout | — | Ends session by clearing `userId` cookie and returning to landing page. |

Cross‑cutting UX:

- **Top bar:** breadcrumb (Dashboard → Page), AI status pill, notification bell, language switcher (EN/HI/MR), compact user avatar.  
- **Education Policy Bar:** bottom‑anchored contextual “Did you know?” strip with RBI/policy facts based on current route.  
- **Notification Center:** fetches and displays alerts (drop‑offs, credit score changes, EMI reminders, etc.).

### 3. AI & Agentic Intelligence

ArthAstra’s intelligence is implemented in layers, backed by deterministic math:

1. **Perception & Knowledge (Vision + RAG)**  
   - Forensic document vision with `gemini-2.5-flash` to inspect Aadhaar/PAN/bank statements.  
   - RAG over `lib/knowledge/company-brain.ts` (RBI rules, documentation requirements, agentic architecture).

2. **Collaborative Planning – Recovery Squad (ADK pipeline)**  
   - **🕵️ Investigator:** analyzes root causes with tools like `calculateDTI`, credit simulators and CIBIL fetcher.  
   - **🐺 Negotiator:** constructs negotiation scripts and lender‑friendly narratives.  
   - **🏗️ Architect:** builds a stepwise, time‑bound recovery roadmap.

3. **Adversarial Judgment – Financial Council (ADK debate)**  
   - **⚡ Optimist:** argues for approval based on strengths and future potential.  
   - **🔒 Pessimist:** argues for rejection based on risk policies.  
   - **⚖️ Judge:** weighs both sides and outputs a binding verdict (JSON‑like structure used by UI).

4. **Global Chat Orchestrator**  
   - `/api/chat` uses an Orchestrator Agent to route each user message to:  
     `ONBOARDING`, `LOAN_OFFICER`, `RECOVERY` or `GENERAL` based on intent.  
   - Responses are short, RAG‑grounded, and aware of the user profile when available.

### 4. Voice & Accessibility

**Bilingual Voice Assistant 2.0**

- Embedded voice assistant orchestrated via `lib/voice-assistant-context.tsx`.  
- Registration of form fields (id, label, question) enables fully voice‑driven onboarding.  
- Navigation commands (e.g. "open eligibility", "show documents") map to dashboard routes.

Hybrid flow:

1. **Continuous feedback:** browser Speech API for instant on‑screen transcription while speaking.  
2. **High‑accuracy finalization:** `/api/voice-transcribe` sends audio blobs to Gemini 2.5 Flash for accurate text (Hindi/English mix, numeric strings, names).

## 🧱 Architecture & Data Flow

High‑level lifecycle:

1. **Onboarding & Registration**
   - User completes steps 1–5 in `/onboarding`.  
   - Frontend posts to `/api/user/register`.  
   - Backend:
     - connects to MongoDB (`connectDB()`),  
     - normalizes phone, initializes `creditScoreHistory`, sample `emiSchedule`, `spendingCategories`,  
     - persists `User`, creates welcome alerts, sets `userId` httpOnly cookie.

2. **Login & Session**
   - `/login` posts to `/api/user/login`.  
   - If phone exists, `sessionTs` updated and `userId` cookie is set.  
   - `UserProvider` fetches `/api/user/me` on mount and provides `user`, `updateUser`, `refreshUser`.

3. **Dashboard Rendering**
   - Layout: `DashboardLayout` wraps all `/dashboard/*` pages.  
   - `DashboardOverview` pulls `user` and runs `calculateDetailedEligibility`, `calculateDTI`, `analyzeEmploymentRisk`.  
   - UI cards (eligibility gauge, docs progress, approval odds) are derived purely from stored user + calculator outputs.

4. **AI Calls**
   - Frontend widgets call APIs:
     - `/api/eligibility-insights` → specialist loan officer agent over deterministic stats.  
     - `/api/rejection-recovery` → ADK Recovery Squad pipeline.  
     - `/api/council-meeting` → ADK Financial Council debate.  
     - `/api/document-analyzer` → Gemini Vision doc analysis.  
     - `/api/chat` → orchestrated chatbot with RAG and tools.

5. **Alerts & Notifications**
   - `Alert` model stores user‑level alerts.  
   - `/api/alerts` exposes fetch + mark‑read.  
   - `/api/alerts/generate` and `/api/cron/process-dropoffs` create alerts and optional WhatsApp nudges for drop‑offs or credit changes.  
   - `/api/notify` formats Twilio WhatsApp/SMS messages for key stages (docs uploaded, credit check started/completed, lender matches).

## ☁️ Deployment Notes

- Container‑friendly: Dockerfile produces a compact standalone Next.js 16 image with `server.js`.  
- Verified on Google Cloud Run (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_GCP.md`) using:
  - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` for Gemini.  
  - `MONGODB_URI` for hosted MongoDB (e.g. Atlas).  
- Any platform that supports Node 22 + Docker (Vercel, Render, etc.) can run this image with the same env vars.

## 🤝 Contributing / Extending

Ideas for extension:

- Add more dashboards or calculators under `components/dashboard`.  
- Add new specialist agents in `lib/agents/specialists` wired through `/api/*` routes.  
- Expand RAG knowledge in `lib/knowledge/company-brain.ts` for more domains (SME loans, home loans, etc.).  
- Enhance accessibility and regionalization (more languages, fonts, contrast modes).

If you plan to contribute, keep these conventions in mind:

- Reuse existing `components/ui` primitives and follow Tailwind class patterns already used.  
- Add new APIs under `app/api/feature/route.ts` using the same error‑handling style.  
- Keep AI flows grounded in deterministic tools first, LLM analysis second.
